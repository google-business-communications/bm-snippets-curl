# Business Messages: curl snippets

These code snippets demonstrate how to perform operations with the Business Messages API using curl commands.

This project contains multiple examples. Each file contains a single operation with the Business Messages API.

To run the curl commands you need to be signed up with [Business Messages](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages/guides/set-up/register).

## Prerequisite

You must have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) (aka gcloud)
- [curl](https://curl.se/download.html)

## Before you begin

1.  Once registered, follow the instructions to [enable the APIs for your project](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages/guides/set-up/register#enable-api).

## How to run the curl commands?

1. Locate the file with the command you want to execute.
1. Replace all the placeholder strings that start with `__`, for example: `__CONVERSATION_ID__`.
1. Make sure the path to your [service account key](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages/guides/quickstarts/prerequisite-setup?hl=en#create_a_service_account) is correct.
